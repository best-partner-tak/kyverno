# Disable privileged containers

Privileged containers are defined as any container where the container uid 0 is mapped to the hostâ€™s uid 0. A process within a privileged container can get unrestricted host access. With `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` enabled, a process can gain privileges from its parent.

To disallow privileged containers and the privilege escalation it is recommended to run pod containers with `securityContext.priveleged` set to `false` and `allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `false`.
