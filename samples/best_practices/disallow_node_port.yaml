    policies.kyverno.io/description: A Kubernetes service of type NodePort uses a 
      host port to receive traffic from any source. A 'NetworkPolicy' resource cannot be used 
      to control traffic to host ports. Although 'NodePort' services can be useful, their use 
      must be limited to services with additional upstream security checks.
