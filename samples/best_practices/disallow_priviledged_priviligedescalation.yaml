    policies.kyverno.io/description: Privileged containers are defined as any container 
      where the container uid 0 is mapped to the hostâ€™s uid 0. A process within privileged 
      containers can get unrestricted host access. With 'securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation' 
      enabled a process can gain privileges from its parent. To disallow privileged containers 
      and the escalation of privileges it is recommended to run pod containers with 
      'securityContext.priveleged' as 'false' and 'allowPrivilegeEscalation' as 'false'.
